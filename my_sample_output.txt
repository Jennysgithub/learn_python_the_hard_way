Hello Joel, here is some text from another file: 
This is some text,
that I'm writing into this file.
I'm not really sure why I'm writing so few words per line.
Maybe you know why?
Maybe I'm weird?
My name is Joel.
Is your name Jenny?
Are you my Jenny?
If you are, then I have a message for you:
I LOVE YOU!
Goodbye Joel
